The assignment submission contains - 
	1. HumanActivityPredictionDraft.html (the solution to the assignment).
	2. HumanActivityPredictionDraft.pdf (same as above but in PDF format).
	3. HumanActivityPredictionDraft.Rmd (the corresponding R Markdown file).
	
The submission is in it's entirety is Report (5 pages) + Appendix (25 pages). As
even a 5 page page may be elaborate or overwhelming to the reader, I would 
recommend reading just the sections INTRODUCTION (Pg1), EXECUTIVE SUMMARY(Pg1) 
and MACHINE LEARNING (Pg4).
